# oceanographer-ec

This is a EC (topre) pcb for Hedgey's [oceanographer](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=114413.0) keyboard. The pcb supports both a 625U spacebar and a split 275U, 225U spacebar configuration, an Oled and rotary encoder.
Each layout requires its own respective plate. The plate files can be found in the production folder.
